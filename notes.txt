NOTE: hte pretrained mobilenet v3 small was downloaded from the torch zoo, NOT THEIR LINK @ https://github.com/winycg/CIRKD/releases/download/backbonev0.1/mobilenet_v3_small-47085aa1.pth
comments : the results does not seem to be the same of the paper.. we should get like 0.62 mIOU

TODO: training with their pretrained weights for mobilenet v3 small + PSPNet

EVALUATING : DEEPLABV3+ and resnet101 (from their link), we get the same results as in the paper (about 0.78 mIOU on cityscapes val)

TRAINING on the conv3x3 mobilenet v3 gives the same results of authors
